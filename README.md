# My Portfolio

As a software developer based in Nigeria, I have experience building websites and applications with JavaScript, React, Redux, Express, NodeJs, Tailwindcss, and MongoDB. With the tools I have, I have built software that actually creates real-life solutions to unresolved problems. I am very capable of learning new skills quickly and am happy to work in any environment.

My strongest suits are on the front end. I have good commercial experience in this area, with a keen interest in expanding my skillset in a diverse range of technologies. I love being part of communities that inspire and challenge one another.

**I am open for new opportunities on-site in Nigeria or London.**

**Support me by giving me star**. ðŸŒŸ

Thanks.
