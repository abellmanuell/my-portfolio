# Abel Emmanuel - Overview

<p>I'm a software engineer, a problem solver, and with my knowledge of software stacks, I have the superpower to transform ideas into reality. Creating solutions for web problems has been the motto that drives my vision. I have over 4+ years of experience creating stunning, accessible, security, functional, and highly performances, cross-browsers and cross-devices compatible websites and mobile responsive applications.</p>

## What I do.

<p>
I develop functional web applications for individuals, companies, and small & medium businesses. As a software engineer with problem-solving skills, I use my software stacks to create solutions to any kind of web problem, giving out working user-friendly and user-experienced software for your business.
</p>

## How I do it.

<p>
When developing, I start with a feature, not a layout. This enables me to stay focused on the objectives or functional goals of the software/projects. The non-frustrating way I handle a project is by separating the project into fragments, building on these pieces, and presenting a befitting job.
